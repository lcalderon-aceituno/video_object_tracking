# Tracking the Displacement of an Object in a Video 

This program is based on a Adrian Rosebrock project avaliable [here](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/21/opencv-track-object-movement/#pyis-cta-modal). All software in object_movement.py was developed by Adrian Rosebrock, PhD. All of the changes from the original program were written entirely by Lydia Calderon-Aceituno and include a graphical display of displacement v.s. real time.
